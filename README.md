# Data Structures

The project includes implementation of multiple Data Structures of template type in C++ so they can be generic and reusable. Following types of implementations were performed and tested:
* Self Sorting Linked Lists
* Circular & Doubly Linked Lists
* Binary Search Trees (BST)
* AVL Trees 
* Splay Trees
* Static Graphs
* Dynamic Graphs
* Hash Tables
* Priority Queues

Languages Used:
---------------
* C/C++

All Implementations were rigorously tested for accuracy and performance.
